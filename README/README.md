# Big Jet Plane(卡) Game

The game's name comes from a song called [*Big Jet Plane*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/big-jet-plane/358822273?i=358822692) by Angus & Julia Stone. It has not particular meaning, just for fun. But the Chinese character in the parentheses has particular. It's exactly the opposite of the meaning of 'S' in the iPhone 3GS, which is sluggishness. The game iiself is a "normal" arcade game. And the following is the rule of this game.

* When objects are added to the window, everything will become sluggish. 
* When your plane is damaged, everything will become sluggish
* When your level increases, the enemy will upgrade, which means they are quicker. So everything will become sluggish.
